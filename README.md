# CDSx

## Common Data Set Exchange

CDSx will simplify the presentation of Common Data Set results, by prescribing
a simple JSON data model, consumed and presented automatically in a 
web page. JSON made sense for me, because most of my complex data are sourced 
programatically in an environment where JSON output is trivial.

This is an unofficial, internal-use tool that I'm sharing with others in the
Institutional Research community. I have no formal ties to the Common Data
Set Initiative.

This is also a learning tool by an occasional programmer. Feedback and
constructive criticism are welcome.

## Usage
cdsx_questions.json 		- question template 
cdsx_answers_sample.json 	- example answer template
cds_report.htm 				- consumes questions & answers, presenting report
							automatically 

## Versioning / Upcoming Changes

Still fleshing out proof-of-concept. Style will come after function.
