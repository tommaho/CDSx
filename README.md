# CDSx

## Common Data Set Exchange

CDSx will simplify the presentation of Common Data Set results, by prescribing
a simple JSON data model, consumed and presented automatically in a 
web page. JSON made sense for me, because most of my complex data are sourced 
programatically in an environment where JSON output is trivial.

This is an unofficial, internal-use tool that I'm sharing with others in the
Institutional Research community. I have no formal ties to the Common Data
Set Initiative.

The official Common Data Set page can be found here: http://www.commondataset.org/

This is also a learning tool by an occasional programmer. Feedback and
constructive criticism are welcome.

## Usage
**cdsx_questions.js** - question template<br>
**cdsx_answers_sample.js** - example answer template<br>
**cds_report.htm** - consumes questions & answers, presenting report	automatically<br>

Note: questions and answers are shown here included from local files, as js
objects. They could be sourced as easily from an api or remote files.

## Versioning / Upcoming Changes

Still fleshing out proof-of-concept. Style will come after function.
